## Installation

Inline-tailwind has great built-in support. You probably won't need to install it. Just use it in your html and you are good. You will not need to uninstall it either. inline-tailwind is so *backwards* compatible that it went a full circle. It supports all brand-new SSR frameworks too.

## Usage

inline-tailwind has way too many features to mention in a readme file. But basically, instead of using the html attribute named "class", inline-tailwind uses the html attribute "style" to make sure your code is backwards compatible.
